Overview
--------
This repository consists of the source code from the RenderScript tutorials I have written.  There may be some differences in the source code vs. the tutorial articles (such as minor improvements and package name or filename changes in order to fit all the code into one repository), but this repository is designed to fully compile and demonstrate each aspect of the tutorials and should prove to be a useful resource.
